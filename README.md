# OPS-IncomeVis
A side project to practice data viz of employee income from publicly available info. Made public
moreso as a demonstration of data viz. 

Employee list retrieved here: https://www.olatheschools.org/domain/50
and saved as directory.mhtml

--> That webpage is converted to a JSON list of employees, which then is
parsed through online sources and to a final JSON list, including income,
and then made into an image
